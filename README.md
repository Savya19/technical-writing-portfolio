Hello, everyone!

My name is Savya P. I am currently in my final year of Bachelor of Technology specialising in Computer Science and Engineering. I have done internships in NIT, Calicut and IIT, Madras in my college journey so far. Through these internships I was able to hone my ability to write technical documents, explaining complex technical terms in easy words, write project reports and project README, and progress reports. I have also gained documentation experience by being part of the documentation team of two clubs in college. I was responsible for creating content for event promotions, and scripts for event. I was also in charge of documenting events that my club put up during technical fests. This is my technical-writing-portfolio.

## About Me

I am a final year student pursuing my undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Technololgy Computer Science and Engineering. I create clear, user friendly documentation which helps in bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and the average non technical user. With my internship experiences in NIT Calicut and IIT Madras, I can create clear and concise project reports, prject progress reports, project README, and SOPs.
